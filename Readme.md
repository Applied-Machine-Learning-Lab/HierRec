# HierRec
- Main Source code for the CIKM'24 accepted paper [Scenario-Aware Hierarchical Dynamic Network for Multi-Scenario Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02061).
- Code is only for reference.
- The dataset file is too large and not provided. So if you want to run the project, please first replace the sample dataset in the "data" folder with the full dataset in the similar format. Then you can do training and inferencing with run_v0.py.
